Today I woke up and went to work at the Astro dept, where I clean up the planetarium and stock room and classrooms,
then I put up new flyers and take down old ones.
Then I went to REI with Megan where she bought a harness for rock climbing.
Taking the 70 bus back to campus, I then had a research meeting, where I am
finding the mass of the milky way from GAIA data for dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
Then I had 323 tutorial and wanted to DIE, and now I am in class!
